# Social Poll

## Vision
Social Poll is a modern web application that allows users to create and answer polls in a feed format. The platform enables anonymous feedback collection at scale, with results only visible after participation. Questions can be upvoted, with popular questions appearing at the top of the feed.

## Project Status
All core features have been completed and implemented. Testing indicates the application should work as expected, though there may be environment-specific setup requirements needed for successful deployment.

## Future Considerations
- Enhanced analytics for poll engagement
- User authentication for managing polls
- Additional social sharing features
