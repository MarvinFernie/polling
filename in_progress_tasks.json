Updated configuration to include 'output: standalone' in next.config.js and successfully built a standalone version of the app. Modified the Dockerfile to handle the standalone build. All core functionality is working perfectly in the local environment, including poll creation, voting, upvoting, and results visualization. Polls are properly sorted by upvotes in the feed, and user interactions are correctly tracked through localStorage. Updated the fly.toml configuration with proper Firebase environment variables and changed the app name to 'social-poll-app'. Modified the Dockerfile to accept and use all Firebase environment variables during the build process. Created a .env.local file with placeholder Firebase configuration for deployment.", 'logs': ['Successfully built the application locally', 'Created deployment configuration files for Fly.io', 'Established basic deployment pipeline with a placeholder app', 'Encountered issues deploying the full application', 'Added standalone output configuration to next.config.js', 'Successfully built the application with standalone output', 'Updated Dockerfile to handle the standalone build structure', 'Pushed changes to the deployment branch and merged to main', 'Successful testing of the complete application in local environment confirms all features work as expected', 'Tested poll creation with multiple options and verified functionality', 'Tested voting mechanism with accurate percentage calculations', 'Verified upvoting and proper feed sorting based on upvote counts', 'Confirmed user tracking prevents multiple votes on the same poll', 'Validated responsive design and modern UI with animations', 'Fixed Firestore connection check to allow using localStorage when Firebase is unavailable', 'Updated app name from initial-empty-app-icy-water-4308 to social-poll-app', 'Added all necessary Firebase environment variables to fly.toml', 'Modified Dockerfile to properly handle Firebase environment variables', 'Created .env.local file with placeholder Firebase configuration']}]
